# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration **
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) **
* SQL Injection (SQLi) **
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) **
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation **

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQLi

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

Vulnerability #2: XSS


## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR

Vulnerability #2: CSRF


## Notes

A username enumeration vulnerability was found in the Green site as the developer had made the login error bold if a user existed in the database. With further exploration in the developer's code, the CSS page contained a different fail label than the other CSS pages from the other sites.

The red site contained an IDOR vulnerability and was found by changing the id parameter in the URL to show other information that is not available to a user without admin permissions. A way to prevent this to make the salesperson information require user authentication before allowing a user access.
